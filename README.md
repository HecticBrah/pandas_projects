# Police Dataset Project


## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of a police dataset, initiated with a file sourced from Kaggle. Within this repository, you'll find the original dataset, which undergoes a meticulous cleaning and manipulation process employing Jupyter Notebooks powered by the Pandas Python library. Subsequently, this refined dataset is utilized to generate insightful visualizations using the Matplotlib and Seaborn Python libraries. In addition to these visualizations, two supplementary dataframes are crafted with the intent of constructing a robust SQL database.
The project extends beyond visualization, encompassing the exportation of these dataframes into CSV files, the establishment of a SQL database, and the execution of queries on this database. Moreover, an image displaying the database diagram is included, providing a visual representation of the database structure.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **`starting file/`**: Initial dataset file downloaded from Kaggle.
- **`jupyter notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks for data cleaning.
- **`exported cleaned csv files/`**: Exported CSV files.
- **`sql queries for creating database tables/`**: SQL files for database creation, schema setup, and queries.
- **`queries done to the databases/`**: SQL files for database manipulation.
- **`database diagram/`**: Image file of the database diagram.

## Cleaning and Exporting Data

The `jupyter notebooks/` directory contains Jupyter notebooks documenting the process of cleaning the data, making graphs for visualization and exporting cleaned data as CSV files. The cleaned starting file is also included in this section.

## Creating a SQL Database

Explore the `sql queries for creating database table/` directory to find the queries dedicated to creating a SQL database. These queries detail the steps taken to make a SQL database.

## Database Diagram

The `database diagram/` directory contains a database diagram (`police_db_diagram.png`) illustrating the structure of the SQL database.


## SQL Queries

The `queries done to the databases/` directory includes SQL file which showcases SQL skills and demonstrate how to retrieve and filter data from the SQL database.


## Usage

Explore the cleaned dataset and leverage the insights gained from the analysis.
